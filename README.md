# Python_Networking
Using Python to set up a peer to server connection and interacting with the server. Using the sockets library.


The program that I wrote is representing the use of networking with python. My software enables a user to run the server file I made and then the client file. This enables the two files to talk with each other. In this case the server and client will be playing rock paper scissors. The client can’t end the game and also it will end the server.

# Network Communication

Using the client/server communication

Using TCP for the communcation

The format that the data is being sent it in the form of bytes

# Development Environment

# Future Work

* Add a working interface
* Make it where the connection can become a peer to peer connection
* Add more games to play on the server side
